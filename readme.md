# Project Proposal
My project plan is to do a currency exchange. It would recive user input and use currency rate api to get the current rates and show users what their exchange would be in a diffrent country. 
Things I would store in the database is the name and the currency rates of the country the api allows.
1. country
2. Currency rate of $1 usd to that country 

ex: 
* "CAD":1.3171828596,
* "HKD":7.7500212134, 
* "ISK":138.6508273229,
* "PHP":48.5625795503,
* "IDR":14720.101824353,
* "INR":73.3088672041,
* "USD":1.0,
* "MXN":21.0537123462,
* "SGD":1.3568095036,
* "AUD":1.4064488757,
* "PLN":3.8797624098
},"base":"USD","date":"2020-10-19"}%
